Q3. Use a nested ternary operator to check that a number is positive, negative or zero. You have to print “positive” if
the number is positive and similarly for negative and zero also.

Answer - const number = 0
number > 0 ? console.log("positive") : number < 0 ? console.log("negative") : console.log("Zero")  // Output zero
